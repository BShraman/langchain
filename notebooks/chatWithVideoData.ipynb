In 1933, the Chicago Bears defeated the New York Giants in the league's inaugural championship game. Though the league featured black players prior, in 1946, the NFL officially integrated. In the 1958 championship game, the Baltimore Colts defeated the New York Giants in sudden death in what became known as the greatest game ever played. 45 million people tuned in, starting an explosion in viewership for future decades. The NFL merged with the American Football League in 1966, with the two league champions playing each other in the first AFL-NFL championship game, which later became known as Super Bowl I. The 1967 championship game was also known as the Ice Bowl, played at negative 13 degrees, so cold it froze the commentators' coffee. This was the Green Bay Packers' fourth NFL title in six years. They then won their second straight Super Bowl title. By 1969, Kansas City Chiefs owner Lamar Hunt named the championship game the Super Bowl after watching his kids play with Super Ball toys. That year, the Jets were the first AFL team to win the Super Bowl, defeating the Colts 16-7. In 1970, Monday Night Football debuted on primetime TV, further raising the league's profile. The 72 Dolphins became the first, and still only, team in the Super Bowl era to finish undefeated. They beat the Redskins in Super Bowl VII to finish the season 17-0.

In 1978, newly introduced rules made defending the pass more difficult. The Steelers capitalized, winning the next two Super Bowls, giving them four in six seasons, cementing a 1970s dynasty. Dwight Clark made the catch to take the 49ers to the 1982 Super Bowl, sparking their 80s dynasty in the era of the pass-heavy West Coast offense. The Cowboys were next in the 90s, winning Super Bowls in 93, 94, and 96. After the attacks of September 11th devastated America, many people found a semblance of normalcy in the 2001 NFL season. That year, a week-two injury to Drew Bledsoe of the Patriots allowed little-known second-year quarterback Tom Brady to take the NFL stage. That year, Brady and the Patriots won the first of six Super Bowls over an 18-season stretch. They entered the NFL's 100th season as defending champions, and Brady has the consensus choice as the greatest player ever. In 2007, the NFL played its first game in London, starting a series of international games that now sees four games a year played in the UK and one in Mexico. In 2019, two of the NFL's founding franchises, the Chicago Bears, originally the Decatur Stalys, and the Arizona Cardinals, originally the Chicago Cardinals, are still part of the NFL in its 100th season.

Dwight Clark made the catch to take the 49ers to the 1982 Super Bowl, sparking their 80s dynasty in the era of the pass-heavy West Coast offense. The Cowboys were next in the 90s, winning Super Bowls in 93, 94, and 96. After the attacks of September 11th devastated America, many people found a semblance of normalcy in the 2001 NFL season. That year, a week-two injury to Drew Bledsoe of the Patriots allowed little-known second-year quarterback Tom Brady to take the NFL stage. That year, Brady and the Patriots won the first of six Super Bowls over an 18-season stretch. They entered the NFL's 100th season as defending champions, and Brady has the consensus choice as the greatest player ever. In 2007, the NFL played its first game in London, starting a series of international games that now sees four games a year played in the UK and one in Mexico. In 2019, two of the NFL's founding franchises, the Chicago Bears, originally the Decatur Stalys, and the Arizona Cardinals, originally the Chicago Cardinals, are still part of the NFL in its 100th season.

In the 1958 championship game, the Baltimore Colts defeated the New York Giants in sudden death in what became known as the greatest game ever played. 45 million people tuned in, starting an explosion in viewership for future decades. The NFL merged with the American Football League in 1966, with the two league champions playing each other in the first AFL-NFL championship game, which later became known as Super Bowl I. The 1967 championship game was also known as the Ice Bowl, played at negative 13 degrees, so cold it froze the commentators' coffee. This was the Green Bay Packers' fourth NFL title in six years. They then won their second straight Super Bowl title. By 1969, Kansas City Chiefs owner Lamar Hunt named the championship game the Super Bowl after watching his kids play with Super Ball toys. That year, the Jets were the first AFL team to win the Super Bowl, defeating the Colts 16-7. In 1970, Monday Night Football debuted on primetime TV, further raising the league's profile.
