# Run LLM Model with OpenAI Integration

This repository provides both Jupyter Notebook and Docker container setups to execute the LLM (Large Language Model) with integrated OpenAI capabilities. You have two options for running the model:

## Google Colab

Execute the provided notebook in Google Colab for a hassle-free experience.

## Local Docker Container

Use Docker and `docker-compose` to run the model locally.

```bash
docker-compose up --build -d

This will build the Docker image and start the Jupyter Notebook service in the background. Access the notebook by opening your web browser and navigating to [http://localhost:8888](http://localhost:8888).
Retrieve the access token from the logs generated by the docker-compose up command.

Feel free to choose the option that best suits your workflow!
